/* You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!

There are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points. Points are as follows:

Chickenwings: 5 points

Hamburgers: 3 points

Hotdogs: 2 points

Write a function that helps you create a scoreboard. It takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants, for example:

[
  {name: "Habanero Hillary", chickenwings: 5 , hamburgers: 17, hotdogs: 11},
  {name: "Big Bob" , chickenwings: 20, hamburgers: 4, hotdogs: 11}
]
It should return "name" and "score" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.

[
  {name: "Big Bob", score: 134},
  {name: "Habanero Hillary", score: 98}
]
Happy judging! */



function scoreboard(whoAteWhat){
  let arr =[]
   whoAteWhat.forEach(({name, chickenwings, hamburgers, hotdogs, score = chickenwings*5 +  hamburgers*3 + hotdogs*2})=>{
        arr.push({name, score})
    })
    
const comparingFunction = (a, b) => {
  if (a.score < b.score) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (a.score > b.score) {
    return -1;
  }

  if (a.score == b.score) {
    if (a.name < b.name) {
      return -1;
    }
    if (a.name > b.name) {
      return 1;
    }
    return 0;
  }
};
