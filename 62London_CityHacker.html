/* You are given a sequence of a journey in London, UK. The sequence will contain bus numbers and TFL tube names as strings e.g.

['Northern', 'Central', 243, 1, 'Victoria']
Journeys will always only contain a combination of tube names and bus numbers. Each tube journey costs £2.40 and each bus journey costs £1.50. If there are 2 or more adjacent bus journeys, the bus fare is capped for sets of two adjacent buses and calculated as one bus fare for each set.

For example: 'Piccadilly', 56, 93, 243, 20, 14 -> "£6.90"

Your task is to calculate the total cost of the journey and return the cost rounded to 2 decimal places in the format (where x is a number): £x.xx
